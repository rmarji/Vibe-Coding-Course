# Roocode Interface Diagram

This is a placeholder for the Roocode interface diagram. In production, this would be replaced with an actual screenshot or diagram of the Roocode interface.

The image should:
1. Show the main Roocode UI components in VS Code
2. Label key areas (prompt input, response output, tools)
3. Highlight command options
4. Include annotations for main features
