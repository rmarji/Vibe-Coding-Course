# Suggested Navigation Updates

The following changes should be made to the `mkdocs.yml` file to improve navigation and incorporate our new resources. These changes will need to be applied in Code mode since Architect mode can only edit markdown files.

## Updates to mkdocs.yml

Update the navigation section in the mkdocs.yml file with the following changes:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Course Overview: overview.md
  - Lessons:
      - "Lesson 1 - Introduction to Vibe Coding and Roocode Setup": lessons/lesson1.md
      - "Lesson 2 - Effective Prompting and Specification Writing": lessons/lesson2.md
      - "Lesson 3 - Basic Code Generation and Editing": lessons/lesson3.md
      - "Lesson 4 - Iterative Development and Workflow": lessons/lesson4.md
      - "Lesson 5 - Debugging and Error Handling with AI": lessons/lesson5.md
      - "Lesson 6 - Refactoring and Optimization": lessons/lesson6.md
      - "Lesson 7 - Advanced Roocode Features": lessons/lesson7.md
      - "Lesson 8 - Testing and Quality Assurance": lessons/lesson8.md
      - "Lesson 9 - Project Deployment and Automation": lessons/lesson9.md
      - "Lesson 10 - Capstone Project & Best Practices": lessons/lesson10.md
  - Resources:
      - Overview: resources.md
      - Cheatsheets: resources/cheatsheets.md
      - Exercises: resources/exercises.md
      - Sample Code: resources/sample-code.md
      - Quizzes: resources/quizzes.md
  - LearningPathAI Project:
      - Project Overview: memory_bank/progressive_project.md
      - Project Guide: memory_bank/progressive_project_guide.md
      - Implementation Plan: memory_bank/learning_path_ai_project_plan.md
  - Memory Bank:
      - Overview: memory_bank/index.md
      - Enhancement Plan: memory_bank/enhancement_plan.md
      - Practical Examples: memory_bank/practical_examples_template.md
      - Visual Elements: memory_bank/visual_elements.md
      - Visual Elements Guide: memory_bank/visual_elements_guide.md
  - About: about.md
```

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Resource Access**: All resources (cheatsheets, exercises, sample code, quizzes) are now directly accessible in the navigation.

2. **Dedicated Project Section**: Created a specific section for the LearningPathAI project, making it easier for students to access project-related materials.

3. **Better Organization**: Separated resources from internal memory bank documentation for clearer navigation.

4. **Consistent Structure**: Maintains the overall site structure while improving accessibility to key content.

Please implement these changes in Code mode to enhance the site navigation structure.
