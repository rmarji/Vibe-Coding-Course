   }
   ```

### 5. First Roocode Prompt

Let's create a simple "Welcome" component for our LearningPathAI project:

**Step 1: Create Initial Component**

```jsx
// components/Welcome.jsx
import React from 'react';

const Welcome = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to LearningPathAI</h1>
      <p>Your personalized learning journey begins here.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Welcome;
```

**Step 2: Use Roocode to Enhance It**

Prompt to Roocode:
```
Enhance this Welcome component to include:
1. Current date and time display
2. A brief explanation of LearningPathAI
3. A call-to-action button
4. Proper styling with Tailwind CSS
```

**Step 3: Enhanced Component**

```jsx
// components/Welcome.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Welcome = () => {
  const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(new Date());
  
  // Update time every minute
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => setCurrentTime(new Date()), 60000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);
  
  // Format date and time
  const formattedTime = currentTime.toLocaleTimeString();
  const formattedDate = currentTime.toLocaleDateString(undefined, {
    weekday: 'long',
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric'
  });
  
  return (
    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto my-12 p-8 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
      <div className="text-right text-gray-500 text-sm mb-4">
        {formattedDate} | {formattedTime}
      </div>
      
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-4">
        Welcome to LearningPathAI
      </h1>
      
      <div className="bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-800 mb-2">
          What is LearningPathAI?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          LearningPathAI is an intelligent platform that creates personalized learning
          paths based on your goals, current knowledge, and preferred learning style.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Using advanced AI, we analyze your needs and create a customized
          educational journey with carefully selected resources and step-by-step guidance.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <button className="bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition duration-300 w-full md:w-auto">
        Start Your Learning Journey
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Welcome;
```

1. Displays user name, avatar, and bio
2. Shows follower count with an icon
3. Has a "Follow" button that toggles state
4. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
5. Handles loading and error states
```

### 9. Common Setup Issues

Troubleshooting guide:

1. API key issues
2. Model availability
3. Extension conflicts
4. Performance problems
5. Network connectivity

## üöß Progressive Project: LearningPathAI

In this course, you'll build a complete project called **LearningPathAI** - an intelligent platform that creates personalized learning paths for users based on their goals and knowledge level.

### Getting Started with LearningPathAI

**Step 1: Project Setup**

Create project directories for frontend and backend:

```bash
# Create main project directory
mkdir learningpath-ai
cd learningpath-ai

# Create frontend and backend directories
mkdir frontend backend
```

**Step 2: Initialize Git Repository**

```bash
git init
```

**Step 3: Create Initial README**

Use Roocode to help create a comprehensive README:

Prompt to Roocode:
```
Create a README.md file for a project called LearningPathAI, which is an
intelligent platform that creates personalized learning paths for users based on
their goals and current knowledge. The application will use React/Next.js for the
frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and integrate with LLMs and Perplexity search.
Include sections for project overview, features, tech stack, and setup instructions.
```

**Step 4: Project Structure**

Use Roocode to help design the initial project structure:

Prompt to Roocode:
```
Create a high-level directory structure for a full-stack application with:
1. A Next.js frontend with React and Tailwind CSS
2. A FastAPI backend with Pydantic models
3. OpenAI and Perplexity API integrations
4. PostgreSQL database integration (to be added later)

Include directories for components, API routes, services, and configuration files.
```
