# Lesson 2: Effective Prompting and Specification Writing

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of clear specifications in AI-assisted coding
- Write effective prompts that generate precise, high-quality code
- Use Roocode's system instructions ("rules") to guide AI behavior
- Break complex tasks into manageable prompts
- Apply best practices to improve AI code output quality

## üìö Lesson Content

### 1. The Power of Clear Specifications

Effective AI-assisted coding begins with clear specifications. When communicating with an AI, clarity and precision are critical:

- Traditional coding: You translate requirements into code yourself
- Vibecoding: You translate requirements into prompts, then the AI translates them into code

Benefits of clear specifications:
- Saves time by reducing back-and-forth iterations
- Results in higher-quality code that meets actual requirements
- Reduces the need for extensive rewriting or debugging
- Creates more maintainable and purposeful code

### 2. Understanding How Roocode Interprets Prompts

Roocode processes your prompts using large language models to understand and generate code:

- **Context awareness**: Roocode analyzes open files and previous interactions
- **Pattern recognition**: It identifies coding patterns and applies them appropriately
- **Implementation knowledge**: It draws on programming best practices
- **Limitations**: It can't read your mind or fully understand vague requirements

### 3. Components of a Great Coding Prompt

An effective prompt typically includes:

1. **Clear objective**: What specific task needs to be accomplished
2. **Context**: The environment, dependencies, and existing code structures
3. **Constraints**: Performance requirements, style guidelines, or limitations
4. **Examples**: Similar code patterns or expected outputs
5. **Technical specifications**: API endpoints, data formats, or specific functions

Example of a weak prompt:
```
Create a login form
```

Example of a strong prompt:
```
Create a React login form component that:
- Has email and password fields with appropriate validation
- Shows error messages below each field when validation fails
- Includes a "Remember me" checkbox
- Has a submit button that calls a login() function
- Follows our project's existing Material UI styling patterns
```

### 4. Example Prompt Walkthrough

Let's create a simple utility function with Roocode:

1. **Initial prompt**:
   ```
   Create a JavaScript utility function that formats a phone number into a standardized format.
   ```

2. **Reviewing the generated code**:
   - What's good about the implementation?
   - What could be improved?

3. **Refining the prompt**:
   ```
   Create a JavaScript utility function that:
   - Takes a string input (possibly containing digits, spaces, and special characters)
   - Extracts only the digits
   - Formats it as a US phone number in the format (XXX) XXX-XXXX
   - Returns an error message if the input doesn't contain exactly 10 digits
   - Includes JSDoc comments
   ```

4. **Analyzing the improved output**:
   - How did the refined prompt lead to better code?
   - What aspects of the prompt were most effective?

### 5. Iterative Prompting (Prompt Chaining)

Complex coding tasks often require multiple prompts in sequence:

1. **Initial implementation**: Get the basic functionality working
2. **Refinement**: Add edge case handling and error checks
3. **Optimization**: Improve performance or reduce complexity
4. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive comments and examples
5. **Testing**: Create test cases to verify functionality

This iterative approach allows you to:
- Maintain context throughout the development process
- Focus on one aspect at a time
- Build progressively more complex features
- Control quality at each step

### 6. Using Roocode's Built-in Rules

Roocode allows you to set consistent "rules" (system instructions) to guide AI behavior:

1. **Accessing rules**: Open the Roocode settings panel
2. **Creating custom rules**: Define how the AI should approach tasks
3. **Example rule configurations**:
   ```
   Always use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
   Follow the AirBnB style guide for code formatting.
   Write comprehensive error handling for all functions.
   Include unit tests for any new functionality.
   ```
4. **When to use rules vs. inline prompts**

### 7. Best Practices for Breaking Tasks into Small Prompts

Large coding tasks should be decomposed into smaller, focused prompts:

1. **Component-based approach**: Develop each module or component separately
2. **Function-level granularity**: Focus on individual functions or methods
3. **Feature-by-feature development**: Build core functionality before adding enhancements
4. **File structure first**: Establish project organization before detailed implementation

Benefits of small, focused prompts:
- Easier for the AI to understand and implement correctly
- Simpler to review and validate
- More efficient use of context window
- Better progressive development flow

### 8. Hands-on Exercise: Writing Effective Prompts

Practice writing prompts for these scenarios:

1. **Data validation function**: Create a function that validates email addresses
2. **UI component**: Develop a notification toast component
3. **API integration**: Write code to fetch and display data from an API
4. **Algorithm implementation**: Create a function to find duplicates in an array

For each scenario:
- Write your initial prompt
- Review the generated code
- Refine your prompt for better results
- Compare initial and final outputs

### 9. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Prompt Writing

Mistakes that can lead to poor code generation:

1. **Vague requirements**: "Make a nice UI" vs. "Create a form with these specific fields"
2. **Inconsistent terminology**: Switching between different terms for the same concept
3. **Overloading the prompt**: Trying to accomplish too much in one go
4. **Missing context**: Not providing necessary information about the environment
5. **Ignoring constraints**: Not specifying limitations or requirements
6. **False assumptions**: Assuming the AI knows project-specific details

### 10. Handling Ambiguous AI Responses

When Roocode's response doesn't meet expectations:

1. **Ask clarifying questions**: "Why did you implement it this way?"
2. **Request alternatives**: "Can you suggest a different approach?"
3. **Provide feedback**: "This works, but I need it to handle this edge case"
4. **Incremental steering**: Guide the AI step-by-step toward the desired solution
5. **Reset and restart**: Sometimes it's better to refine your prompt and start fresh

## üéØ Practice Exercises

1. **Specification Writing**
   - Choose a common programming task
   - Write a detailed specification for it
   - Share and compare with other learners

2. **Prompt Refinement**
   - Start with a basic prompt
   - Iteratively improve it based on the results
   - Document how each refinement improved the output

3. **Rule Creation**
   - Create a set of rules for a hypothetical project
   - Test how they influence code generation
   - Evaluate which rules are most effective
