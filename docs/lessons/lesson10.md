### 4. Iterative Prompting, Debugging, and Testing Recap

Apply the techniques learned throughout the course:

#### Effective Prompting Strategy for Complex Projects

1. **Start with high-level structure**: Begin with architecture and components
2. **Progressive refinement**: Move from general to specific implementations
3. **Focused prompts**: Target specific functionality in each prompt
4. **Context management**: Provide necessary context for each interaction
5. **Iterative improvement**: Build, test, refine in small cycles

#### Example: Debugging Strategy

1. **Identify issues**: Use testing to find problems
2. **Isolate the bug**: Narrow down to specific components
3. **Prompt for analysis**: Ask Roocode to analyze the issue
4. **Implement fixes**: Apply suggested solutions
5. **Verify resolution**: Test to confirm the fix works

#### Example: Test-Driven Development

1. **Write tests first**: Define expected behavior
2. **Generate implementation**: Ask Roocode to create code that passes tests
3. **Run tests**: Verify functionality
4. **Refine as needed**: Iterate until tests pass
5. **Expand test coverage**: Add edge cases and additional scenarios

### 5. Refactoring and Optimization in Practice

Improve the code quality of our project:

#### Refactoring Targets

1. **Code duplication**: Identify and eliminate redundant code
2. **Complex functions**: Break down into smaller, focused components
3. **Inefficient algorithms**: Optimize performance bottlenecks
4. **Inconsistent patterns**: Standardize implementation approaches
5. **Technical debt**: Address accumulated shortcuts or workarounds

#### Example: Performance Optimization

```
I've noticed our task list component is slow when displaying large numbers of tasks. Here's the current implementation:

```jsx
function TaskList({ tasks }) {
  const [filteredTasks, setFilteredTasks] = useState([]);
  const [filterCriteria, setFilterCriteria] = useState({
    status: 'all',
    priority: 'all',
    assignee: 'all'
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let result = [...tasks];
    
    if (filterCriteria.status !== 'all') {
      result = result.filter(task => task.status === filterCriteria.status);
    }
    
    if (filterCriteria.priority !== 'all') {
      result = result.filter(task => task.priority === filterCriteria.priority);
    }
    
    if (filterCriteria.assignee !== 'all') {
      result = result.filter(task => task.assignee === filterCriteria.assignee);
    }
    
    // Sort by various criteria
    result.sort((a, b) => {
      if (a.priority === 'high' && b.priority !== 'high') return -1;
      if (a.priority !== 'high' && b.priority === 'high') return 1;
      
      if (a.dueDate && b.dueDate) {
        return new Date(a.dueDate) - new Date(b.dueDate);
      }
      
      return 0;
    });
    
    setFilteredTasks(result);
  }, [tasks, filterCriteria]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="filters">
        {/* Filter controls */}
      </div>
      
      <div className="tasks-container">
        {filteredTasks.map(task => (
          <TaskItem key={task.id} task={task} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Please optimize this component for better performance with large task lists.
```

### 6. Ensuring Robust Tests and Deployment Automation

Ensure quality and reliability for our project:

#### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **API tests**: Verify endpoint behavior
4. **End-to-end tests**: Test complete user flows
5. **Performance tests**: Measure and optimize response times

#### Example: Generating Full Test Suite

```
Generate a comprehensive test suite for our task management API endpoints:

Endpoints to test:
- GET /api/tasks - List all tasks
- GET /api/tasks/:id - Get a specific task
- POST /api/tasks - Create a new task
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update a task
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete a task
- POST /api/tasks/:id/comments - Add a comment
- GET /api/tasks/statistics - Get task statistics

For each endpoint, include tests for:
1. Successful operations
2. Authentication requirements
3. Authorization rules
4. Input validation
5. Error handling
```

#### Robust Deployment Pipeline

1. **Environment configuration**: Set up development, staging, production
2. **Continuous integration**: Automated testing on code changes
3. **Deployment automation**: Scripted deployment process
4. **Rollback strategy**: Plan for reverting problematic changes
5. **Monitoring**: Track application health and performance

#### Example: Deployment Pipeline Design

```
Design a deployment pipeline for our task management application with the following stages:

1. Build: Compile code and create artifacts
2. Test: Run all test suites
3. Analysis: Run code quality and security scans
4. Staging: Deploy to staging environment
5. Validation: Run smoke tests on staging
6. Approval: Require manual approval for production
7. Production: Deploy to production environment
8. Verification: Verify production deployment

Include appropriate failure handling, notifications, and monitoring at each stage.
```

### 7. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

Create comprehensive documentation for the project:

#### Documentation Categories

1. **User documentation**: How to use the application
2. **API documentation**: Details on all endpoints and parameters
3. **Architecture documentation**: System design and components
4. **Developer documentation**: Code organization and patterns
5. **Deployment documentation**: How to deploy and maintain

#### Example: Generating API Documentation

```
Create comprehensive API documentation for our task management system. Include:

1. Base URL and authentication requirements
2. Detailed endpoint descriptions
3. Request parameters and body structure
4. Response formats and status codes
5. Example requests and responses
6. Error handling information
7. Rate limiting details
8. Versioning information
```

### 8. Exercise: Complete Mini-Project

Apply all techniques to a smaller project for practice:

#### Mini-Project: Personal Finance Tracker

Build a simple personal finance tracking application with:
- Income and expense tracking
- Category management
- Financial reports and visualizations
- Budget planning
- User authentication
- Mobile-responsive interface

**Steps:**
1. Plan the application structure and features
2. Implement the backend API
3. Create the frontend with React
4. Add authentication and authorization
5. Implement testing for all components
6. Set up deployment configuration
7. Document the application

### 9. Common Mistakes in Iterative Prompting

Avoid these pitfalls in vibecoding workflows:

#### Common Mistakes

1. **Overly broad prompts**: Asking for too much in one prompt
2. **Insufficient context**: Not providing necessary background
3. **Ignoring errors**: Not addressing issues before continuing
4. **Skipping tests**: Not verifying functionality
5. **Inconsistent terminology**: Using different terms across prompts
6. **Premature optimization**: Optimizing before basic functionality works

#### Example: Improving Prompting Strategy

**Ineffective prompt:**
```
Create a complete task management system with React frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB database, user authentication, task CRUD operations, assignments, comments, categories, tags, dashboard, email notifications, and deployment configuration.
```

**Effective alternative:**
```
Let's start planning our task management system. First, let's define the core entities and their relationships:

1. Users: People who can create and manage tasks
2. Tasks: Units of work with properties like title, description, status
3. Comments: Feedback or notes attached to tasks
4. Categories: Ways to organize tasks by type

Can you help me create an initial data model diagram showing these entities and their relationships? After that, we'll plan the API endpoints and frontend components.
```
